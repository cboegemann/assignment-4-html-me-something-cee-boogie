  <h2 class="dish" id="breakfast">Breakfast</h2>
  <p>I don't have pancakes, bacon and eggs for breakfast too often but sometimes you have to treat yourself to one of your favorite early morning classics if you want to start your day ready to take on life's horrors. I've also been making quiche every now and again, usually with some combo of bacon, onion, spinach, peppers, and cheese. I start my mornings with a slice of quiche a lot lately. An alternative favorite morning go-to is a smoothie with bananas, strawberries, blueberries, peanut butter and whole milk. I don't add anything green to my smoothies because whenever I try that it makes my morning sad.

   <h2 class="dish" id="friedchicken">Fried Chicken</h2>
   <p>Oh by the way - I somewhat recently made some of the tastiest fried chicken I've ever had in my life. After I was fully vaccinated, I visited my brother and we did a TON of cooking together. One night I made a giant batch of absolutely delicious fried chicken. The next morning, my brother made poached eggs and we turned some leftovers into chicken and waffles. (We did not make the waffles. Sue me.) </p>

   <h2 class="dish" id="ribs">Ribs</h2>
   <p>There was a fateful moment when I was at the store and they were selling racks of ribs with a "buy-one-get-two-free" deal. So of course, I purchased three racks of ribs for the price of one, and put some in the freezer so that they were ready for me whenever a craving for ribs would strike me. Did I include too many pictures of ribs in this section? I don't know, man.</p>

   <h2 class="dish" id="sides">Sides</h2>
   <p>&#9835; Let's talk about sides, baby. Let's put them in my belly. Let's talk about all the good things and the great things sides can be. Let's talk about sides. &#9835;
   <br>
   <br>Ya'll. I LOVE having the right sides round out a meal. A truly euphoric pandemic platter has a plate where you can tell the side dishes were made with love, too! I started making my mashed potatoes with bacon fat. Honestly, bacon fat makes collard greens, brussels sprouts, and potatoes all just sing. I haven't used bacon fat in a dish in a minute because I'm working on finding new ways to enjoy my veggies that aren't so tough on the old arteries. Hop to my section on <a href="#thanksgiving">Thanksgiving dinner</a>, though, if you're interested in seeing a bunch of my favorite sides to cook all on one plate!
   </p>
   <img src="images/sides/IMG_0483.jpg" class="landscape">
   <p>It'S really fun experimenting with different types of veggies to turn into sides. On St. Patrick's Day, I made lamb and I accompanied it with black turnips that my friend had given me. I had never even heard of black turnips before! They came out really tasty, and I made some loaded mashed potatoes to round out the meal.</p>

   <h2 class="dish" id="sauces">Sauces</h2>
   <p>I started making my own barbecue sauces and tomato sauces from scratch a few years before the pandemic started, but it's an art I've continued to perfect when the mood strikes. I know it doesn't look like much, I have made homemade bbq sauces for pulled pork, ribs, and pulled jackfruit, and my recipe is always something I make up on the spot and it's always some sweet and spicy glorious tastebud sensation. I also really enjoy making tomato sauce from scratch when I have too many tomatoes to know what to do with! My favorite things I've made to eat with homemade tomato sauce have been meatballs and gnocchi - both which I've made from scratch on days where I just had too much time on my hands.</p>

      </tr>
   </table>
   
   <h2 class="dish" id="poke">Poke</h2>
   <p>I got into a poke making phase during the pandemic. I regularly used imitation crab because I get nervous about properly handling fish that would be eaten raw. I would make sushi rice and then top it with whatever I had around - tomatoes, mango, seaweed salad, avocado, carrots, cucumber... you name it! It became a really fun way to add some variety and fresh foods into pandemic menu. Oh - and building on mentioning making sauces above - I also got into mixing my own sauces for my poke bowls!</p>

      </tr>

   <h2 class="dish" id="seafood">Seafood</h2>
   <p>I am the first to admit that I love to eat seafood but don't feel very confident about cooking it. However, every now and again I'll buy some shrimp and cook that up and throw on top of some veggies that I coat in Lao Gan Ma's Spicy Chili Crisp - it's so tasty and I highly recommend that you give the chili crisp a try if you aren't familiar with it!
   <img src="images/seafood/IMG_6892.jpg" class="landscape">
   <br>I occasionally volunteer with a local group in Philly that plans a different volunteer event once a month. During the pandemic, the group pivoted to remote ways for us to give back to others. Two of their remote events during the pandemic involved cooking for others. One involved cooking a set of meals of fish, lentils, and veggies to be shared out with individuals staying in a local shelter. I really hope the recipients of the food that I cooked enjoyed their meals.</p>

   <h2 class="dish" id="veggies">Veggies</h2>
   <p>Taking a moment to acknowledge how beautiful and delicious veggies can be! I tried swiss chard for this first time this pandemic. I've been working more salads into my daily life. Overall, I made a conscious decision to try to increase my veggie intake and doing so has greatly expanded the spectrum of flavors, textures, and colors of the food that I eat on a regular basis. In addition to trying new things, I continue to revisit one of my longtime favorites, as well: I love to nom on a black bean quesadilla with guacamole.</p>

   <p>There are lots of delicious ways to enjoy veggies without cooking them in bacon fat or butter! 
   <br>See? Cheese is a great accompaniment, too!</p>
   <img src="images/veggies/IMG_8239.jpg" class="landscape">
   
   <h2 class="dish" id="burgers">Burgers</h2>
   <p>I started making my own veggie burgers from scratch. I've experimented with making white bean burgers flavored with gochugaru and my homemade kimchi. I serve those with a fried egg and gochujang sauce. I also love making spicy black bean burgers and topping them with guacamole or mango. I even made broccoli burgers with pesto - they were really tasty, I swear! It's been so fun to experiment with different burger recipe ideas.</p>

   <p>Of course, I still am always a loyal to a decent cheeseburger made from good old fashioned blended cow. I LOVE a cheeseburger with fried onions, mushrooms, bacon and blue cheese. Also great - a burger topped with tomatoes I grew in my garden! The burger on the right below is one I ate yesterday, and it's topped with Cherokee purple tomatoes that I picked that same day.</p>

   </table>
   
   <h2 class="dish" id="kimchi">Kimchi</h2>
   <p>I mentioned above that one of the veggie burgers I made up a recipe for was a white bean burger made with gochugaru and my own homemade kimchi. That white bean kimchi burger became one of my favorite things to eat in this pandemic. Sometimes, instead of eating the kimchi white bean burgers on a bun, I'll eat it over rice - again with a fried egg and gochujang sauce. </p>
   <table class="table">

      </tr>
   </table>
   <img src="images/kimchi/IMG_8216.jpg" class="landscape">
   <p>One of the other fun things that I made with kimchi was kimchi pork dumplings. I bought a bamboo steamer during the pandemic and started trying different frozen dumplings, pork buns, shumai - whatever sounds fun when I'm scouring the freezer at my local Asian grocery store. It was really fun to try my hand at making my own dumplings, with my kimchi pork dumpling attempt.</p>

   <h2 class="dish" id="gnocchi">Gnocchi</h2>
   <p>I recently made colorful gnocchi from scratch by starting with colorful potatoes. In the past I've enjoyed gnocchi with pesto or with tomato sauce, both of which I've tried my hand at making from scratch in the past too!</p>
   <table class="table">
      <tr>

   <h2 class="dish" id="thanksgiving">Thanksgiving Dinner</h2>
   <p>I didn't go home for Thanksgiving in 2020, but I made turkey and a bunch of sides and packaged food to go to send off with my dad, my brother, and one of my best friends so that they could each have a full Thanksgiving dinner even if we weren't spending it together. I made all the things my mom always used to make and bring to my aunt's for Thanksgiving dinner: stuffed mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and green bean casserole. I also made cranberry sauce, apple sauce, honeynut squash stuffed with sage sausage, brussels sprouts with apples and bacon, bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese, carrots, and turkey that I smothered in gravy. It was all really tasty! I missed my family so much this Thanksgiving but I felt grateful that everyone continued to be safe and healthy during such a challenging year. I definitely coped by eating my feelings.</p>

   <h2 class="dish" id="sweets">Sweets</h2>
   <p>I am a person who loves chocolate, fruit, butter, and sugar, so you bet I love all kinds of desserts. I'm also very lucky because I live near some excellent bakeries. During the pandemic, it felt really important to me to support my local bakeries with my dollar. I want them to stay in business and it's a fun way for me to get to try new treats that take a level of skill I might not be patient enough to work towards, myself. So while I do eat tasty treats, I don't do a lot of baking. However, I have to say I love having fruit around. Some simple treats I've enjoyed indulging in during the pandemic that I've made myself have been chocolate covered strawberries and mango sticky rice. These types of desserts are a reminder that some of the tastiest foods in the world are fruits and vegetables eaten fresh or accentuated by flavors that celebrate their natural appeal. As someone who thinks that fresh blueberries or a perfectly ripe peach are some of the tastiest things on earth, I just wanted to celebrate these simple desserts I've made, too. Shoutout to desserts that are tasty without an overly complicated ingredient list and with no expert levels of prep required!

   <p>One of the greatest privileges of my life is that I have enough food to eat. Even when I feel lonely, I have people I can reach using the incredible powers of technology that exist at my fingertips. Not everyone is so lucky. 
      <br>When Valentine's Day 2021 approached, my country was approaching its year anniversary since lockdown began. I was feeling very lonely and sad. I wasn't alone in my sense of loneliness. A friend of mine shared with me that she was going to be spending some time ahead of Valentine's Day by baking cookies to donate to a local nonprofit that manages shelters that house people in need of shelter. The nonprofit had put out a simple request to folks to make baked goods and sweet things to share with shelter residents who might be feeling particularly lonely and down given the challenges of the moment. My friend and I agreed we'd both make sweets to donate, separately, and then walked our batches of sweets over together. I know it doesn't impact the dire nature of anyone's situation when they receive a goodie bag of Rice Krispie treats, chocolates, and cookies, put together by a complete stranger for them for Valentine's Day. But I do hope that these goodies helped make someone's day feel the tiniest bit less lonely, for a moment.</p>

   <h2 class="dish" id="thought">Food for Thought</h2>
   <p>During times of quarantine, I really missed sharing meals with people I like and love. Bonding over a meal can be such a joyous experience. It felt lonely to adjust to cooking for only myself, constantly, during the pandemic. Even so, I know I am a very lucky person because I was always able to feed myself. Of course, there are many people living in our world who are not fortunate enough to be able to access enough food, let alone to access a wide variety of foods to experience. It's a struggle for many people to aquire a sufficient amount of food on a consistent basis. To access food that is nutritous and delicious is an even greater challenge for many individuals. 
   <br>
   <br>An odd thing about humans is that even when we do have the ability to access enough food, sometimes it is hard to eat properly and take care of ourselves. Even if food is accessible, we may still struggle with food for many reasons. I've often struggled to eat enough when I've felt sad or anxious. When I am overcome with grief or despair, I tend to lose my appetite. I lacked an appetite a lot during this pandemic. It's with the support of my friends and family that I was able to cook a lot of the things I shared on this page - even as we were distanced. I had many days that felt incredibly hard to slog through. The friends and family that found ways to stay connected despite being socially distanced truly made a huge difference in my ability to do things as basic as getting out of bed and forcing myself to drink a smoothie just to get something in my system so I could get through the day. It can be very difficult to engage in healthy eating habits when we are sad, hurting, anxious - when our days are overbooked with obligations and yet more disheartening news. 
   <br>
   <br>It certainly seems true that the world is a tough place. Even so, try to be kind to yourself and allow yourself to savor even the simplest and smallest of joys, when you can get them. I picked some peppers from my garden the other day and I've been wondering what to make with them. I am considering trying to make my own version of a hot pepper jelly, or perhaps a chutney. Who knows? But to see the peppers in my back yard turn from green to red and to wonder how hot they will be - that's a source of small but signficant joy for me.
   <br>
   <br>I hope you enjoyed my attempts to share some meals with you.</p>
